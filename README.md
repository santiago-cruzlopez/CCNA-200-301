The following folders contain Cisco Packet Traces scenarios with real world problems to solved, this helped me pass the CCNA 200-301 certificate, and I extracted the documents to serve as a study method.

One of the things that will help you is to have experience with switches and routers and in the event that you do not have the money to practice with a real one, you can use the Cisco Packet Tracer simulation, in addition to understanding how to solve complex problems. When taking the exam, you must keep in mind that you will also have to configure switches and routers virtually, so it is better to be well prepared beforehand and this is a very good option.

Note: Due to copyright, I did not make any of these documents, as I had mentioned before, I extracted them from Internet and sometimes it is difficult to find that type of content, which is why I have decided to upload them to GitHub.
